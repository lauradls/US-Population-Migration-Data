The tax return of every individual has an address field, wherein the individual fills in his current address. This field can be leveraged to identify whether the individual; can be classified as a migrant or not. The individual could have migrated from one county to another within a state, from one state to another state, from the United States to a foreign location, or not migrated at all. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States maintains a migration database by comparing the address field of an individual’s tax returns from two consecutive years. In this project, we propose to analyze the migration trends in the United States between the years 2015 and 2020. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Our research topic is U.S. Population Migration patterns from 1990 until 2020. The goal is to explore the inflow and outflow of people between states and counties within the United States of America. With this data, there is an opportunity to create visualizations to detect patterns not only based on geographic location, but also across different age groups and income levels. Data exploration and the analysis will be cemented on the Migration Data Users guide published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 2.2 Data availability The data is made available, collected, and maintained by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which is a bureau of the Department of the Treasury and one of the world’s most efficient tax administrators. In the fiscal year 2020, the IRS collected almost $3.5 trillion in revenue and processed more than 240 million tax returns. The IRS maintains a lot of tax statistics data with respect to a variety of fields like business tax, individual tax, charities, etc. The migration data is derived from Form 1040 which is filed by residents of the United States of America. The tax return data of an individual are matched based on their Tax Identification Number (TIN). After the matching procedure is completed, these are classified into one of 4 categories : Non-migrant returns, Migrant return - different state, Migrant return - same state - different county, Migrant return - foreign 2.2.1 Data Format and Frequency The data is publicly available as zipped Excel files (.xls) on the IRS website, composing multiple datasets for each fiscal year. To import the data, we need to download these files to our local computers and then upload to RStudio, which is the software we will use to conduct the analysis. The IRS leverages the change in address on the Tax return from one year to another year to generate the migration data. Despite the fact that the IRS provides help services for individuals and businesses looking at their tax returns, there is no contact information for data-related issues. As we encounter questions about the data, our approach will be to explore the online resources available on their website. 2.2.2 Scope The primary data that we will be analyzing is the summary of the migration flows within the states for 5 years from 2015 to 2020. This data contains the following fields: The number of returns: which indicates the number of households that migrated. The number of individuals: which indicates the number of individuals that migrated. Adjusted Gross income: which indicates the gross income after deducting certain adjustments like dividends, interests, etc… Age: which indicates the age of individuals filing their return Geographical data: Geographical data like State name, State code are also included. Migration status: Migration statuses like Inflow, Outflow, Same state migration is included in the data. The data for each state is split into 7 categories based on the adjusted gross income of the household. In addition to this, in case we discover any particular trend or anomaly for a state, we plan to use more granular data per state. This data contains the following fields: Destination information The number of returns: which indicates the number of households that migrated. The number of individuals: which indicates the number of individuals that migrated. Adjusted Gross income: which indicates the gross income after deducting certain adjustments like dividends, interests, etc.. 2.2.3 Data Quality It is important to note that the data does not represent the entire US population because there can be several individuals who might not be filing tax returns despite having an income. Tax returns that are filled without a state code or with an incorrect state code are excluded. Similarly, if someone filed their tax return after September of a given year, it will not be included to maintain uniformity. Returns received in 2019 indicate the income earned in 2018, and returns received in 2020 indicate the income that was earned in 2019, and so on. The migration data cannot be compared to other data that relates to sources of income (SOI) because the migration data only compares the tax returns for 2 consecutive years. 2.2.4 References (https://www.irs.gov/about-irs/the-agency-its-mission-and-statutory-authority) (https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-data-by-geographic-area) (https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-migration-data) (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/1920inpublicmigdoc.pdf) Sample Data by State - New York Data year 2019-2020 Data year 2018-2019 Data year 2017-2018 Data year 2016-2019 Data year 2015-2016 "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources As mentioned in the previous chapter the data is made available, collected, and maintained by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The primary source of this migration data is derived from Form 1040 which is filed by residents of the United States of America. The tax return data of an individual are matched based on their Tax Identification Number (TIN). After the matching procedure is completed, these are classified into one of 4 categories : Non-migrant returns, Migrant return - different state, Migrant return - same state - different county, Migrant return - foreign The data file that we chose for our analysis is the master migration file which contains the migration patterns and data for all the states spread over a span of 5 years from 2016 to 2020 over different age groups. One of the key issues that we faced while interpreting the data was a large number of categorical variables. Age, Income, and Type of migration were all provided as categorical variables and in a very haphazard manner. These variables were organized in a very unorderly manner and it was very difficult to analyze the data belonging to different categories. Hence, we decided to convert the data frame into the tidy data frame format (more details on this are provided in the next section). The data file which we used for analysis contains the following variables: State_code – This column indicates the integer code of the state State – This column indicates the name of the state. Returns – This variable indicates the number of households that filed their returns Individuals – This variable indicates the total number of individuals AGI_Year1 / AGI_Year2 – These two variables indicate the average gross income (income after deduction of taxes, dividends, etc) on the 2 returns that are filed which are used to identify the migration status. All the AGI amounts are reported in thousands of dollars. Age – This variable indicates the age category of the individual filing the return GTI – This variable indicates the gross total income of the individual filing the return Status – This variable indicates the migration status of the return Year – This variable indicates the year in which the tax return was filed. One anomaly we noticed while exploring the data is that the data collection is not consistent in District of Columbia (D.C). There were a few returns filed for certain age groups. On the same note, because D.C. does not have any counties, the values for in-state migration are equivalent to zero. In addition to the master data file, we also used the state data frame from the maps library. We leveraged this file to obtain the coordinates to plot the various states of the country. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation For this process, we had to change the structure of the data as it was presented as an .xlsx file with different groups under several layers of merged cells. Using the tidy approach of “one variable per column and one observation per row”, we turned 143 columns into 11, while keeping the core information intact. Excluding demographic data, our dataset had four core columns of information: number of returns, number of individuals, AGI 1 and AGI 2. These were repeated for each each age group and migration flow status combination. Through the data cleaning and transformation process, we created new columns to flag Age and Migration Status, instead of having separate sections of the file for each. This allowed us to append rows horizontally instead of vertically. Similarly, instead of having a different dataset per year, we collapsed these into one by creating a “Year” column into the main dataframe for the 5 years that we will be evaluating. The “Total” group was also removed as it was occupying unnecessary space and becoming confusing when extracting summary statistics in R as it would have incorrectly inflated these metrics. We took a similar approach where State was labeled as “Total”. With these arrangements, the dimensions of our dataframe changed from having 5 datasets 416 x 143 to one dataset 54,600 x 11. Transformation Our data contains different demographic information that were initially imported as “character” class type. In order to correctly process and visualize the different groups, we transformed these into factors. As we ensured that ordering was respected, if present, we also that the majority of groups did not follow a particular order. See breakdown below of this split: Unordered factor(s): State code, State, State name, Status Ordered factor(s): Age, Gross Total Income(GTI) 3.3 Missing value analysis The data available on the IRS website for our analysis does not include any missing values. Data has been aggregated at a total number of returns levels and organized in a way that no values are missing. Initially, we saw an indication of values being imputted with zero, but as the analysis progressed we noticed that these had a legally sound reason for the true value to be zero. Below, you can see the landscape of our data for missing values. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Migration of Individuals 4.2 Number of Tax Returns 4.3 Temporal Analysis | Migration by Year", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Migration of Individuals Since the data set is quite large, we have considered a subset for the analysis of the Average gross income of the states for the migrants who have migrated out of the state over all the age groups: For the age group under 26, we can observe that the Average gross income of the migrants has increased in the states of California, New York, and Texas with Texas recording the biggest increase in 2020. For the age group of individuals between 26 and 35, we can observe that the Average gross income of the migrants has increased in the states of California, New York, and Texas from 2016 to 2017 but there has been a decrease in California and Texas from 2017 onwards. The AGI of New York for this category has increased continuously over the years from 2016 to 2020. For the age group of individuals between 35 and 45, we can observe that the Average gross income of the migrants has decreased over the years in the states of California with Texas recording similar figures over the years. From the graph, we can see that there has been a sudden increase in the average gross income from 2019 to 2020. For the age group of individuals between 45 and 55, we can observe that the Average gross income of the migrants has decreased over the years in the states of California with Texas recording similar figures until 2019 and then dropping in 2020. In this category, we can also observe that Illinois is also a significant contributor over other states. From the graph, we can see that there has been an incremental increase in the average gross income from 2018 to 2020 For the age group of individuals between 55 and 65, we can observe that Florida has a relatively high average gross income as compared to other states. New York is another state that has a relatively high average gross income. For the age group of individuals who are 65 years and above, we can observe that the Average gross income of the migrants has decreased over the years in the states of California with Texas recording similar figures over the years and then dropping in 2020. From the graph, we can see that there has been an incremental increase in the average gross income from 2019 to 2020. Migration flow within the United States is driven by several competing forces. Although it is all happening in the same country and it varies from State to State, it also affects Age groups and Income levels differently. During the 2016-2020 period, we observe the majority of individuals staying within their county. Based on the chart below, the most transient group is composed of individuals making between $1 to $10,000 as they moved out, moved around, and moved into a different state. Our assumptions are that this could be due to having bigger needs to look for better employment opportunities and they might also have the flexibility to move around more if they do not have stable/long term contracts. On the other hand, the most stationary group is individuals making $200,000 or more per year. This can be tied to the fact that they might not need to change their primary residence, are comfortable where they live and if desired, they could have the discretionary income to spend time at their second home (i.e. during COVID-19). Comparing the type of migration across age groups reveals insights that are more in line with our previous assumptions. Younger people tend to migrate more than older adults. There seems to be a negative relationship between age and moving. 4.2 Number of Tax Returns The following observations can be made from the above graph which is a facet graph of the number of returns with respect to the age category (The number of returns is the number of households that migrated): We can observe that among all the groups, the same state migration dominates interstate migration. However, in states like Florida, senior individuals especially the ones above the age of 55 prefer to move to another state than move to a different county in the same state The majority of the migrants are in the age group of 25 and 35. These individuals might be moving in search of better career and employment opportunities. The following observations can be made from the above graph which is a facet graph of the number of returns with respect to income of households ( The number of returns is the number of households that migrated): In most of the income categories, the same-state migration dominates the inflow and outflow migration. Maximum migration has been observed in the 25000 USD – 50000 USD income category Least migration has been observed in the 200,000 USD and above income category In states like Texas and Florida compared to all the other states, the inflow migration is greater than the outflow migration which means that more individuals are entering these states than exiting 4.3 Temporal Analysis | Migration by Year The following observations can be made from the above graph which is a facet graph of the number of returns with respect to the year Over the span of 5 years, migration is highest in the states California and Texas compared to all the other states. One possible reason could be the low tax rates in Texas and the vast variety of opportunities( like software development) available in California. Over the span of 5 years, inflow migration is greater than outflow migration in Texas and Florida and it’s the other way in all the other states (Top 5 states with migration figures) All 3 types of migration are high in all the top 5 states in 2017 compared to the other years In all the states, Same state migration dominates inflow and outflow migration The following observations can be made from the above graph which is a facet graph of the number of returns with respect to the type of migration over the span of 5 years In all the states, migration peaked in 2017 and then reduced over the next few years and it again increased in 2019. One of the reasons for a possible hike in migration patterns in 2017 could be the introduction of new migration laws in 2017 by the US government. Over the span of 5 years from 2016 to 2020, Florida has the maximum inflow migration , California has the maximum outflow migration and California and Texas have the maximum same state migration. The following observations can be made from the above graph which is a time series line that shows the number of non-migrant households over the span of 5 years. There is a dip in the number of people who did not migrate in the year 2017 This is in accordance with the previous graph that shows an increase in migration in 2017 compared to all other years from 2017 to 2020. The following observations can be made from the above graph which is a facet graph of the number of tax returns of the migrant population with respect to the type of migration over the span of 5 years. The figures for states like Texas, California, New York, and Florida are high because their population size is significantly greater than those of other states. Texas is one of the very few states where the inflow migration is greater than the outflow migration. One of the many reasons could be low tax rates in Texas. Hence a majority of the migrants prefer to settle in Texas as compared to other states. Of all the states, the outflow migration is maximum in California. One of the many reasons for this trend could be the cost of living. It is far more expensive to live in California as compared to any other state in the United States. The above graph is a detailed analysis of the previous graph wherein we can see the different types of migration in the top 10 states.The following observations can be made from the above graph: In the top 10 states, the same state migration dominates the interstate migration. In states like Ohio and Michigan , the inflow and outflow migration are almost equal in numbers and this trend prevails over the span of 5 years from 2016 to 2020.

For this interactive part, we want to zoom into what happened between 2019 and 2020 when COVID-19 hit the United States. Both traditional new sources as well as social media posts broadcasted that people left the city to go other places. The trend observed on this period is that New York had a bigger outflow of individuals than inflow. With 1/2 million individuals leaving New York, did some of the states bordering New York experienced the opposite? Where did the New Yorkers go to? Can you guess which state had a higher inflow of people versus outflow (if any)? Click on the buttons below to find out! "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion The United States of America houses the most number of immigrants than any other country in the world. Not only are the international migration figures very high, but the domestic migration figures are also quite high in the United States. People migrate from one state to another, from one county to another county within the same state due to a variety of reasons. In this project, we set about analyzing the migration trends within the US over the past 5 years and found some interesting findings. One of the many features that we analyzed in the migration patterns is income. We observed that the subset of the population who make less than $10,000 USD per year migrates the most and the ones who earn upwards of $200,000 USD tend to migrate the least. Another important feature that influences migration patterns is age. People who are young and less than 25 years of age migrate the most and the proportion of the population that migrates keeps on decreasing with an increase in age. One possible reason for this could be that people who are young tend to move around more in search of better education and employment opportunities. Another crucial trend that we observed in the migration patterns over the past 5 years was a sudden increase in domestic migration in the year 2017. The migration figures peaked in 2017, came down over the next two years, and then increased again in 2020. In 2017, the United States government imposed several reforms that had a major impact on the immigration pattern. Some of these were the RAISE Act, Kate’s Law, a Border wall with Mexico, a pause on granting “Green Cards” and so on. Many of these new laws impacted people’s lives and forced them to migrate in search of safe, inexpensive neighborhoods and better employment opportunities. We also observed the migration pattern with respect to the various states in the country. Texas is one of the very few states where the inflow migration is greater than the outflow migration. One of the many reasons could be low tax rates in Texas. Hence a majority of the migrants prefer to settle in Texas as compared to other states. Of all the states, the outflow migration is maximum in California. One of the many reasons for this trend could be the cost of living. It is far more expensive to live in California as compared to any other state in the United States and being a tech hub, remote work is very popular, giving people the flexibility to move around. In very few states like Arizona, Nevada, and Washington State, interstate migration dominates the intra-state migration. One possible reason could be the limited education and employment opportunities in these states which force people to move to other states. We also analyzed the average gross income of states over the span of 5 years to check if it played a major role in influencing the migration trend. No specific trend was found, the AGI increased in some states over in some age groups but decreased in the case of other age groups. We would like to summarize this project and conclude by saying that migration patterns in the US can vary significantly over time and can be influenced by a variety of factors such as economic conditions, political developments, natural disasters, and other events. The United States has a long history of immigration and has historically been a destination for people from around the world seeking new opportunities and a better way of life. The U.S. has also experienced significant internal migration, with people moving between states and regions for a variety of reasons.
